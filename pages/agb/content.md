Delivery dates and deadlines must be indicated in writing. In case of contract modifications a posteriori, a new delivery date and a new deadline must simultaneously be defined. The extension period starts with the receipt of the reminder sent to System provider. An obligation to pay indemnities under the legal title of delay is subject to premeditation or gross negligence of System Provider. An agreement on a rental period will be subject to availability in due time. Unforeseeable circumstances out of the control of System Provider entitle System Provider to rescind the lease contract under exclusion of claims of the contractual partner or postpone the rental period correspondingly.
2. The delivery and fulfillment delays and deadlines apply only under the premise that all details of the contract are fully clarified and all required documents or official certificates and permits have arrived.

## VII. Warranty:

1. The legal warranty provisions apply with the following derogations:
2. Any warranty of System Provider will be void if the contractual partner or a third party processes, modifies, or improperly handles the objects delivered by System Provider as well as if defects are due to weather effects in consequence of improper storage. Excluded from the warranty are furthermore defects in case of mounting not made by System Provider (not applicable if the self-assembly was agreed by the parties and professionally made). The warranty will also be void in case of damages resulting from insufficient equipment, non-compliance with the installation requirements and conditions, overstrain beyond the specifications of System Provider, improper handling and/or use of inappropriate materials, etc. System Provider doesn’t assume responsibility for defects resulting from effects of devices connected by the client and not originating from System Provider.
3. Warranty claims cannot be deduced from information in catalogues, folders, advertizing material or other written or oral statements which have not been declared in writing as parts of the contract.
4. Defects under guarantee will be repaired, at System Provider’s discretion, either through rework, replacement, or price reduction. Redhibition is mutually excluded.
5. Even a timely notice of defects doesn’t entitle the contractual partner to retain amounts invoiced.
6. All warranty claims of the contractual partner expire after 6 months from the date of fulfillment. The contractual partner must register and substantiate any complaint within three working days after identifying the defect; otherwise, complaints will be disregarded.

## VIII. Indemnities:

1. The contractual partner is liable towards System Provider pursuant to the legal regulations, unless otherwise specified hereinafter.
2. System Provider is obliged to act according to the principles of due diligence with due regard to the interests of the client.
3. All warranty claims are excluded unless they result from an intentional or grossly negligent infringement committed by System Provider or its legal representative. The presence of gross negligence and/or premeditation must be proved by the contractual partner. Liability for a certain success, consecutive damages of all kinds, loss of profit, and claims of third p¬arties against the client is absolutely excluded.

Oral acknowledgments of employees or subcontractors of System Provider are irrelevant without the express consent of the third-party insurance of System Provider. Damages not reported until the moment where System Provider leaves the place of the event, the contract, or the fulfillment or damages which cannot/could not be examined by System Provider, its insurance, or a person authorized and mandated by System Provider or damages not brought to System Provider’s knowledge immediately after the contract fulfillment are excluded from System Provider’s liability. System Provider thus insists on a final inspection and examination of possible damages. The third party mandated by, or acting on behalf of, System Provider will, as appropriate, record all damage events (damage listing) and submit the records to the client. If the client foregoes a final inspection, examination, or immediate statement of possible damages, he discharges System Provider from any liability.
