## IV. Proprietary rights and copyright:

1. All objects and services delivered as well as ideas, drafts, quotations, etc. transmitted by System provider (including parts thereof) remain the property of System Provider. Without the consent of System Provider, they cannot be reproduced or disclosed to third parties and can anytime be recalled by System Provider.

5. System Provider doesn’t assume liability for damages caused by the lack of required official or private permits or the non-consent of third parties.

## VI. Deadlines:

1. System Provider strives to meet agreed-upon deadlines. Non-compliance will entitle the contractual partner to exercise his rights only after according to System Provider an extension of at least 14 days, except forward operations pursuant to an explicit agreement. Delivery dates and deadlines must be indicated in writing. In case of contract modifications a posteriori, a new delivery date and a new deadline must simultaneously be defined. The extension period starts with the receipt of the reminder sent to System provider. An obligation to pay indemnities under the legal title of delay is subject to premeditation or gross negligence of System Provider. An agreement on a rental period will be subject to availability in due time. Unforeseeable circumstances out of the control of System Provider entitle System Provider to rescind the lease contract under exclusion of claims of the contractual partner or postpone the rental period correspondingly.
2. The delivery and fulfillment delays and deadlines apply only under the premise that all details of the contract are fully clarified and all required documents or official certificates and permits have arrived.

## VII. Warranty:

1. The legal warranty provisions apply with the following derogations:
2. Any warranty of System Provider will be void if the contractual partner or a third party processes, modifies, or improperly handles the objects delivered by System Provider as well as if defects are due to weather effects in consequence of improper storage. Excluded from the warranty are furthermore defects in case of mounting not made by System Provider (not applicable if the self-assembly was agreed by the parties and professionally made). The warranty will also be void in case of damages resulting from insufficient equipment, non-compliance with the installation requirements and conditions, overstrain beyond the specifications of System Provider, improper handling and/or use of inappropriate materials, etc. System Provider doesn’t assume responsibility for defects resulting from effects of devices connected by the client and not originating from System Provider.
3. Warranty claims cannot be deduced from information in catalogues, folders, advertizing material or other written or oral statements which have not been declared in writing as parts of the contract.
4. Defects under guarantee will be repaired, at System Provider’s discretion, either through rework, replacement, or price reduction. Redhibition is mutually excluded.
5. Even a timely notice of defects doesn’t entitle the contractual partner to retain amounts invoiced.
6. All warranty claims of the contractual partner expire after 6 months from the date of fulfillment. The contractual partner must register and substantiate any complaint within three working days after identifying the defect; otherwise, complaints will be disregarded.

## VIII. Indemnities:

1. The contractual partner is liable towards System Provider pursuant to the legal regulations, unless otherwise specified hereinafter.
2. System Provider is obliged to act according to the principles of due diligence with due regard to the interests of the client.
3. All warranty claims are excluded unless they result from an intentional or grossly negligent infringement committed by System Provider or its legal representative. The presence of gross negligence and/or premeditation must be proved by the contractual partner. Liability for a certain success, consecutive damages of all kinds, loss of profit, and claims of third p¬arties against the client is absolutely excluded.
4. Indemnities by System Provider will become unconditionally inapplicable if the contractual partner or a third party processes, modifies or improperly handles the objects delivered by System Provider as well as if defects result from weather effects or inappropriate storage. Indemnities are furthermore inapplicable for damages in case of mounting not made by System Provider (not applicable if the self-assembly was agreed by the parties and professionally made), insufficient equipment, non-compliance with the installation requirements and conditions, overstrain beyond the specifications of System Provider, improper handling and/or use of inappropriate materials, etc. System Provider doesn’t assume responsibility for defects resulting from effects of devices connected by the client and not originating from System Provider.
5. Any claims against System Provider (on whatever legal ground) will be limited to the agreed-upon remuneration or the sum insured by the third-party insurance of System Provider.
6. The acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the liability of System Provider resides exclusively with the third-party insurance of System Provider. Oral acknowledgments of employees or subcontractors of System Provider are irrelevant without the express consent of the third-party insurance of System Provider. Damages not reported until the moment where System Provider leaves the place of the event, the contract, or the fulfillment or damages which cannot/could not be examined by System Provider, its insurance, or a person authorized and mandated by System Provider or damages not brought to System Provider’s knowledge immediately after the contract fulfillment are excluded from System Provider’s liability. System Provider thus insists on a final inspection and examination of possible damages. The third party mandated by, or acting on behalf of, System Provider will, as appropriate, record all damage events (damage listing) and submit the records to the client. If the client foregoes a final inspection, examination, or immediate statement of possible damages, he discharges System Provider from any liability.
7. Any claim settlement or fixation of an amount is exclusively in the competence of the third-party insurance of System Provider.

## IX. Force majeure

1. System Provider is exempted from the duty to perform in cases of force majeure. Force majeure events include any unforeseeable conditions and other circumstances whose effects on the contract fulfillment are beyond the sphere of influence of both parties. These conditions include absence of means of transportation or electricity failure, mobilization, state of defense, natural disasters, terroristic acts, and riots. In such cases of force majeure, the delays and deadlines will be prolonged with the allowance of a reasonable starting period. In case of impossibility, System Provider cannot be held responsible.

## X. Cancellation/Termination:

1. The contractual partner is entitled to terminate the contractual relationship with System Provider at any time. If the client rescinds the contract, 30% of the agreed-upon remuneration will be charged as cancellation fee. If the cancellation is made less than four weeks before the agreed-upon start of work, the fee will be 50%, if less than two weeks, 75%, and if less than one week or after start of work, 100% of the agreed-upon remuneration (see also the special terms for leases). In case of premature dissolution of the contractual relationship, the client is obliged to fully pay for services already provided. The court’s right to reduce the indemnities is excluded. If the damage exceeds the lump rates stipulated above, System Provider can also claim the exceeding damages.
2. System Provider is entitled to terminate with immediate effect this contract in the presence of an important reason. Such conditions include in particular:

  - Because of the behavior of the client or persons attributable to the latter, the continuation of the contractual relationship seems unacceptable.
  - The contractual partner is in arrears with due payments, be it only partly.
  - Insolvency proceedings related to the assets of the client are applied for or commenced.
  - Insolvency proceedings are dismissed due to insufficient assets to cover the cost.
  - Other concerns related to the solvency of the client have emerged.
  - Before signing the contract, the contractual partner made false statements or concealed circumstances whose knowledge would have restrained System Provider from concluding the contract.
  -The client is in violation of essential provisions of the contract or the GTC.

3. In the event of termination of the contract for an important reason, System Provider is entitled to demand from the client indemnities amounting to the agreed-upon remuneration less already made payments and less any saved expenses.

## XI. Labeling/Advertizing:

1. System provider is authorized to place a reasonable amount of promo material on equipment made available and at the venue – without any remuneration for the client.
2. System Provider is entitled to point out their proprietary rights on objects made available to the client using appropriate labeling. The contractual partner is not allowed to arbitrarily remove or blur these labels.

## XII. Special terms for leases:

1. If System Provider acts (even only partly or within a general contract) as a hirer, the provisions in this section will be applicable too:
2. Independently of a potential advance for the duration of the lease, System Provider can demand a caution amounting up to the time value of the rental properties. This caution will be refunded by System Provider to the contractual partner after expiration of the lease contract and receipt of the properties in proper condition.
3. If System Provider is not in the position to procure an item, System Provider can fulfill the contract by providing an equivalent item.
4. The contractual partner is obliged to take out and cover all usual insurances for the rental property. Also the cost of transport insurance will be at the client’s charge.
5. The contractual partner is obliged to examine the proper condition of the equipment before acceptance; by accepting it, he declares that the rental property is free of defects.
6. In the event of a delayed delivery of the rental property due to gross negligence of System Provider, the contractual partner can claim indemnities for replacement only but not for loss of profit.
7. The place of delivery is the principal office of System Provider. In case of shipment, shipment from the office will be at the client’s risk.
8. The contractual partner has to ensure the aptitude of the installation location for the rental property to be installed. Additional expenditures incurred by System Provider due to an inappropriate location will be at the client’s charge.
9. Claims under warranty against System Provider are excluded unless a defect has been brought, in writing, to System Provider’s knowledge within three days after its detection, if the contractual partner doesn’t fulfill his contractual duties, the rental property has been modified by third parties or through the integration of non-original parts, the contractual partner doesn’t observe the instructions concerning the handling of the property, the damage is due to negligent or improper handling, the contractual partner of System Provider doesn’t accord sufficient time for executing any required improvement and replacement.
10. Delivered items remain the property of System Provider.
11. The contractual partner is liable to pay compensation to System Provider for all damages resulting from improper, non-conform or inappropriate use of the rental property. In the event of a total loss, the contractual partner has to pay the replacement value. In case of damage, the contractual partner will have to compensate for the replacement value if repair would be impossible or uneconomic, otherwise the contractual partner will have to bear the costs of repair.
12. The contractual partner is obliged to immediately inform System Provider about problems regarding the rental property or any modifications in relation with the rental property. In case of infringement, System Provider is entitled to claim damages against the contractual partner.
